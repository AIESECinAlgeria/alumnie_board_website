#WordPress ReadMe

This is the README file for WordPress. Below are instructions for installation, updating, migrating from other systems, system requirements, recommendations, online resources, final notes, sharing the love, and licensing information.

##Installation: Famous 5-minute Install

Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser. It will guide you through setting up a wp-config.php file with your database connection details.
If the above step does not work, open wp-config-sample.php with a text editor like WordPad and fill in your database connection details.
Save the file as wp-config.php and upload it.
Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser.
Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will create the necessary tables for your site. If there's an error, double-check your wp-config.php file and try again. If it fails, visit the WordPress support forums with as much data as possible.
Note: If you did not enter a password during installation, note the password given to you. If you did not provide a username, it will be admin.
The installer should then redirect you to the login page. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can change it by clicking on "Profile."
Updating

Open wp-admin/update-core.php in your browser and follow the instructions.
